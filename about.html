        <h2>About Blake Varnadoe</h2>
        <p>Blake Varnadoe is the ONLY prodigy author to ever write thrillers for an adult audience. He is twelve years old (birthday July 3, 2012) and has depression, autism, and generalized anxiety disorder. In the womb, there were several occurrences where his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck, choking him. He survived all of these occurrences. In the late stages into the womb, a tear occurred, leaking essential fluids. Doctors told Wendy Varnadoe, Blake's mother, that he would not survive and that this also would cause potentially fatal side effects for her. Both of them stand alive today, in LaGrange, Georgia. Blake has two brothers, and one sister. Brenden Folds, Gavin Folds, and Kinsleigh Varnadoe. His father is Clint Varnadoe. At a very young age, Blake also discovered his ability to read, write, and teach. Watching shows like SuperWhy, he taught himself how to read books at age two. His favorite show was Pocoyo. In fact, he'd walk around the house in his baby slippers yelling "Pocoyo, Pocoyo!". At four years old, in Pre-K, he attempted teaching his peers how to read as well, however, he could not achieve this. He won the Rockin' Reader award at Callaway Elementary School in LaGrange, Georgia. Later in life, around eight years old, he moved to Lafayette Christian School. He failed to make friends, but his teachers saw that he was actively uplifting some sad students, making them active. He won multiple awards for his kindness at the annual award ceremony in his school. Sadly, once the Collaborative program relocated, that's when students started bullying him. That's where the depression took root, and why he's now homeschooled. Around this age, he started writing a children's book, titled The Adventures of Mr. Doozie and Mrs. Lucy. He eventually stopped writing this book, and moved on to deeper genre, and older age groups. He wrote short stories, progressively moving from middle grade to young adult to eventually stories aimed for adults. This led him to write a sci-fi/horror novel titled Eclipsar. Now, he engaged with his audience on platforms like Facebook, and holds multiple book signings in Troup County.</p>
