        <h2>About Blake Varnadoe</h2>
        <p>
Blake Varnadoe is the ONLY prodigy author to ever write thrillers for an adult audience. He is thirteen years old, published <i>Eclipsar</i> at twelve (published April 5, 2025) (born July 3, 2012) and has depression, autism, and generalized anxiety disorder.

In the womb, there were several occurrences where his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck, choking him. He survived all of these occurrences. In the late stages into the womb, a tear occurred, leaking essential fluids. Doctors told Wendy Varnadoe, Blake's mother, that he would not survive and that this also would cause potentially fatal side effects for her. Both of them stand alive today, in LaGrange, Georgia.

Blake has two brothers, and one sister: Brenden Folds, Gavin Folds, and Kinsleigh Varnadoe. His father is Clint Varnadoe.

At a very young age, Blake discovered his ability to read, write, and teach. Watching shows like <i>Super Why!</i>, he taught himself how to read books at age two.

At four years old, in Pre-K, he attempted teaching his peers how to read as well. He won the Rockin' Reader award at Callaway Elementary School in LaGrange, Georgia. Around eight years old, he moved to Lafayette Christian School. Though he struggled to make friends, he uplifted sad students and earned multiple awards for his kindness.

Sadly, bullying took root after a school program moved. That's when the depression took hold—and why he's now homeschooled.

Blake wrote a children’s book titled <i>The Adventures of Mr. Doozie and Mrs. Lucy</i>, but soon moved toward older genres, eventually writing <i>Eclipsar</i>, a sci-fi/horror novel for adults.

He now engages readers through Facebook and holds book signings throughout Troup County.
